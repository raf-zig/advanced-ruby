In this project, you have a Knight piece, which has a basic move of two steps forward and one side that can face any direction. The board consists of 2-dimensional coordinates. The function, #knight_moves, can list the steps taken in the shortest path from original position to destination chosen by the user.
Breadth-First Search is used in determining the shortest path in the graph. The graph has nodes of all possible moves the Knight
can make in its current position.
